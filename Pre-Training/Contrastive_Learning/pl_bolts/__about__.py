What is it?
-----------
Bolts is a collection of useful models and templates to bootstrap your DL research even faster.
It's designed to work  with PyTorch Lightning

Subclass Example
----------------
Use `pl_bolts` models to remove boilerplate for common approaches and architectures.
Because it uses LightningModules under the hood, you just need to overwrite
the relevant parts to your research.

How to add a model
------------------
This repository is meant for model contributions from the community.
To add a model, you can start with the MNIST template (or any other model in the repo).
Please organize the functions of your lightning module.
